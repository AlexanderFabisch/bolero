BOLeRo
======

BOLeRo (Behavior Learning and Optimization for Robots) provides tools to learn
behaviors for robots. That includes behavior representations as well as
reinforcement learning, black-box optimization, and evolutionary algorithms and
imitation learning. It provides a C++ and a Python interface to be efficient
where this is required and to be flexible and convenient where performance is
not an issue. Because the library provides a C++ interface, it is easy to
integrate in most robotic frameworks, e.g. the robot operating system (ROS) or
the robot construction kit (Rock).

scripts

    git clone git@git.hb.dfki.de:team-learning/bootstrap.git
