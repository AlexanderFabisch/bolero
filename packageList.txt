# This file contains the packages that should be build.
# Everything between '#' and '\n' is a comment and will be ignored when parsing
# this file
#
# Each package has to be a sub-directory containing a CMakeLists.txt file.
# The sub-directories are visited in order of appearance in this list. 
# If a package 'A' depends on another package 'B', 'A' should be listed after
# 'B' otherwise the dependency resolution will not work.
#
# NOTE: You need to run cmake again whenever this file changes
