The goal of bolero is to easily combine behavior learning algorithms with
learning problems by interfacing a problem as **environment** and the learning
algorithm as **behavior search**.
The whole communication between a behavior and an environment is done by lists
of floating point values. Meaning the actions a behavior can perform and the
sensory information generated by an environment are defined by double values.
