About
=====

The goal of bolero is to easily combine behavior learning algorithms with
learning problems. The whole communication between a behavior and an
environment is done by requesting actions generated from the behavior and
sensory information generated by an environment.

Features
--------

The highlights of BOLeRo are

* Dynamical Movement Primitives (with a final velocity greater than 0, see
  `Muelling et al. <http://www.ausy.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/uploads/Publications/Muelling_IJRR_2013.pdf>`_)
  in C++ with a Python wrapper
* Contextual Relative Entropy Policy Search (see `Kupcsik et al.
  <http://www.ausy.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/uploads/Publications/Kupcsik_AAAI_2013.pdf>`_)
* a clean and readable implementation of Covariance Matrix Adaption
  Evolution Strategies (CMA-ES, see
  `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES>`_) and several of its
  variants
* it is easy to combine it with the simulation software
  `MARS <https://github.com/rock-simulation/mars>`_
* C++ interface to Python modules and Python interface to C++ modules
* configuration via YAML
